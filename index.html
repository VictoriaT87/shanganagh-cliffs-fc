        <p>About SCFC

            Shanganagh Cliffs FC was founded by Shanganagh Community Project in 2009, as a chance for the local males
            aged 18-30 to get together once a week to play football with friends.

            Since then, SCFC has grown in numbers to a team of 25 and have entered into an official league, the Athletic
            Union League, Division 3A Saturday and have had strong seasons within the top 5 places since.

            Matches are played each Saturday, either home or away.</p>
