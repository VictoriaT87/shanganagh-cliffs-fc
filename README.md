# Shanganagh Cliffs Football Club

Welcome to the Shanganagh Cliffs Football Club website! This site has been created to allow fans and community members of this small local football club in South Dublin, Ireland to see how the club started, find the latest news and fixtures and to contact the club for the purpose of signing up to play.

The website also has a contact form which will allow local businesses to get in touch with a chance to sponsor the club - a very important feature for local clubs which still rely on money paid in by the players for travel and kit expenses.
