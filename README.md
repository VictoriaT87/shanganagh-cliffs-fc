# Shanganagh Cliffs Football Club

Welcome to the Shanganagh Cliffs Football Club website! This site has been created to allow fans and community members of this small local football club in South Dublin, Ireland to see how the club started, find the latest news and fixtures and to contact the club for the purpose of signing up to play.

The website also has a contact form which will allow local businesses to get in touch with a chance to sponsor the club - a very important feature for local clubs which still rely on money paid in by the players for travel and kit expenses.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on both the main index page and the contact form page, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to each section of the Home page -  the Logo, About, News, Fixtures and the current League Table - as well as to the separate Contact Form page. This allows for easy navigation across the site.
  - Connected to the Navigation bar is a "Return to Top" button. This will show to the bottom right of the screen when the user scrolls below the header and allows the user to easily return to the Navigation menu with one button. 
  - These 2 items together allows the user to easily navigate from each section of the Index page back to the top Navigation, as well as easy access to the Contact Form page without needed to scroll back up to the top or pressing the refresh or back buttons. 
  - A hamburger menu will appear when the screen is scaled down to smaller screen sizes. This hamburger menu will open from the side with a bold red background to continue the website's color scheme.
